/*The typeof operator returns the type of the argument. Itâ€™s useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check.

It supports two forms of syntax:

As an operator: typeof x.
As a function: typeof(x).
In other words, it works with parentheses or without them. The result is the same.

The call to typeof x returns a string with the type name:

typeof undefined // "undefined"
 
typeof 0 // "number"
 
typeof true // "boolean"
 
typeof "foo" // "string"
 
typeof Math // "object"
